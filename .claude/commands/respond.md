# Respond to PR Review Feedback

You are addressing review feedback on a PR. If a PR number is provided, use #$1. Otherwise, detect the current branch and find its PR.

**Comment Filter**: If a second argument is provided ($ARGUMENTS after the PR number, or the entire $ARGUMENTS if no PR number), use it to filter which comments to address. This can be:
- A keyword or phrase to match (e.g., "naming", "tests", "security")
- A reviewer's username to only address their comments
- "unresolved" to only address unresolved threads
- A specific description of what to focus on (e.g., "only the type errors", "ignore style suggestions")

## Step 1: Identify the PR

```bash
# If PR number provided, use it; otherwise get from current branch
if [ -n "$1" ]; then
  PR_NUMBER=$1
else
  PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number -q .number 2>/dev/null)
fi

echo "Working on PR #$PR_NUMBER"
```

## Step 2: Fetch Review Comments

```bash
# Get all reviews and comments
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json reviews,comments,reviewRequests

# Get review threads (includes line comments)
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments
```

## Step 3: Analyze Feedback

First, if a comment filter was provided, identify which comments match the filter criteria. Only proceed with those comments.

**If filter provided**: List all comments, then clearly identify which ones match the filter and will be addressed vs which will be skipped.

Categorize each piece of feedback (within the filter scope):

1. **Must Fix**: Blocking issues, bugs, security concerns
2. **Should Fix**: Valid improvements, better practices
3. **Consider**: Suggestions, style preferences (discuss if disagreeing)
4. **Skipped**: Comments outside the filter scope (acknowledge but don't address)

## Step 4: Address Feedback

For each actionable item:

1. Make the necessary code changes
2. Ensure tests still pass (or add new tests if needed)
3. Keep changes focused - only address the feedback, don't scope creep

```bash
# Run tests after changes
pnpm test

# Type check
pnpm run typecheck
```

## Step 5: Commit Updates

Use a clear commit message that references the feedback:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: address review feedback

- <summary of changes made>
- <another change>

git push
```

## Step 6: Reply to Comments

For each review comment, reply to acknowledge:

```bash
# Reply to a specific review comment
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments/{comment_id}/replies \
  -f body="Done - <brief explanation of change>"
```

Or use the PR conversation:

```bash
gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body "Addressed feedback:
- ✅ <item 1>
- ✅ <item 2>
- 💬 <item discussed/pushed back on with reasoning>"
```

## Step 7: Request Re-review (if needed)

```bash
gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER --add-reviewer <reviewer-username>
```

## Step 8: Report Summary

Provide:

1. List of changes made
2. Any feedback you pushed back on (with reasoning)
3. Comments skipped due to filter (if filter was applied)
4. Outstanding items (if any)
5. Current PR status
